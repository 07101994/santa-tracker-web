# Setup

You'll need node installed, then bower (`npm install -g bower`). You'll also need `Compass` 1.0.1 available on your path, which is kind of a pain to install if you have 0.12ish, sorry.

Clone project, then

`bower install`

`npm install`

then `gulp --pretty` to build.

The raw site can be served from the root directory, or the built version can be
served out of `./dist_pretty`.
