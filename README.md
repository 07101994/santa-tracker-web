You'll need node installed, then bower (`npm install -g bower`).

Clone project, then

`bower install`

`npm install`

then `gulp` to build.

The raw site can be served from the root directory, or the built version can be
served out of `./dist`.

To wrap source files for serving via crazy django-like servers, use `gulp wrap`
to build.
